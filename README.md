**IDB: Static Header And Footer**

**Documentation**

08.25.2022

**Hello!**
==========

Here is some documentation to hopefully make it easier for you to implement a solution with these files and help foster collaboration between the various dev teams.

1.  Why the static option
2.  What's in these files
3.  What is needed to make these files work
4.  Next Steps

### **Why the Static Option**

Ultimately we don't know where this is going to be hosted. So we created these files as a starting point. But this is an open conversation. So please reach out with any questions or thoughts.

We chose the static option because of its simplicity and flexibility. In addition, this gives us a good starting point on which to iterate. This is a test, so some back and forth is expected.

We created a folder for each language. Each is a static site, but feel free to reorganize.

### **What's in the files?**

A folder for each language translation, containing the following:

-   Language-specific HTML header
-   Language-specific HTML Footer
-   Outline Javascript
-   IDB Styles

These files are not connected to Outline, so if the Storybook is updated, those updates would need to be manually input into the static files. However, since these are the test files, we will correct them shortly before launching to the site's latest code.

### **What is needed to make these files work?**

A server or consumer of some type is needed. These files will not work on your computer without a server. A simple way to create a server on a local environment is by using `npx` with the `npx serve` command in the command line. You can also use [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) to see what the output of the files looks like.

Once a server or consumer is set up, please let us know what kind you have. If modifications happen to the code in the testing process or if you need changes. Just let us know. We want to stay in sync.

### **Next Steps**

Think of this as the starter pack. We know this may feel incomplete. But more data is needed before we know if there are changes from our end. Overall this approach saves time and effort. So feel free to reach out through Ale, and we can set up a time to brainstorm and solve any issues.
